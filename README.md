## ü§ñ How to train ‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ô

The only Method available is Manual Training a.k.a hard code (Idk what to do üòÖ)

```./assets/json/```

* activity.json : Status bot can use

* keywords.json : Keywords to trigger ‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ô

* morequotes.json : Aggressive stuff for ‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ô to say on top of already quality quotes in [narze/awesome-salim-quotes]("https://github.com/narze/awesome-salim-quotes").
   To use this feature, create this file with only one properties '‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏£‡∏°‡∏™‡∏•‡∏¥‡πà‡∏°' set its value to array of your custom quotes.

* salim.json : ‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ô can send link to person's facebook, simply append a dictionary consists of 'url' and 'name' to the array!

### Keywords adding guideline

Keywords must be all lowercase (if english alphabet exists) and no space in it.

‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ô operate the sentences by ignoring spaces and turning all english alphabet into lowercase, for example

`sinovac, sInOvAc, S I N O V A C` will all trigger the "sinovac" keywords

### Trained by People

People in Discord can also train the bot by typing `!train <Quote>`

This can also be disabled or limited to some person in bot settings

Run utils/review.py to review pending words and add to file!
