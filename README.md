# Salim Discord Bot V3

**Fun Fact**: This is my *most active* project on GitHub

V1 and V2 didn't gone because it's riskyness. Just that I rewritten it to improve overall maintainability.

## Legacy Salim Bot

- 2.2.431 [Last of V2](https://github.com/Leomotors/Salim-Bot/tree/52ec1163deec606aaeed0a6cd6968815edd3f94c) (Before implementing newly written [s-bot-framework](https://github.com/Leomotors/s-bot-framework))
- 1.15.248 [Last of V1](https://github.com/Leomotors/Salim-Bot/releases/tag/1.15.248) (Before rewritten in Version 2)
- 1.13.213 [Before TS ~~(ThakSin)~~](https://github.com/Leomotors/Salim-Bot/releases/tag/1.13.213) (JavaScript Version)

*which each major version have some feature dropped, lmao*

## Current Salim Bot: Running Salim Bot Framework

V3 of Salim Bot is now implemented by newly written Salim Bot Framework, Available as *s-bot-framework* on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/s-bot-framework)

### Not sponsored by

`s-bot-framework` is specific for Salim Bot, but if you would want to create
normal Discord Bot, this is a good library =>
[Cocoa Discord Utils](https://github.com/Leomotors/cocoa-discord-utils)

## ‚ùì What is this Bot?
