# Salim Discord Bot

This bot is Salim. Whenever you trigger it, It become mad.

**April Fools!!!** Wait, it passed? nvm, idc.

This discord bot is created to use for my own server. However, source code is free for anyone to implement it.

Spread headache to your friend!

**Warning**: This repo is made for closed group entertainment purpose (say `‡∏õ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ô`) only. This Repository's owner *will not be responsible* for any wrong uses. Proceed at your own risk!

## ü§ù Quality Quote & üí° Inspiration

Thank you for **Quality** Salim Quote from [narze/awesome-salim-quotes](https://github.com/narze/awesome-salim-quotes)

**Note**: This Bot on default will pull quotes from that repository everytime it starts.

That Repository also inspire me to create this annoying '‡∏õ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ô' Bot.

## üë®‚Äçüíª To Implement

In case you want to (not recommend)

* Clone or Download Repo

* ```npm install```

* ```./fileinit.sh``` to create files that is necessary for program

* Then, at generated auth.json, add your token there

  **Note**: You will have to create your own bot in Discord Developer

* Compile the code with typescript, ```tsc --build```

  **Note**: There maybe compilation error on some devices like raspberry pi,
   my solution is to compile it in linux and transfer compiled one to run

* Run the bot with nodejs: ```npm start```

**Note**: If your system doesn't use `python3` for Python 3, don't forget to set its prefix in `bot_settings.json`

## ü§ñ How to train ‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ô

The only Method available is Manual Training a.k.a hard code (Idk what to do üòÖ)

```./assets/json/```

* activity.json : Status bot can use

* keywords.json : Keywords to trigger ‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ô

* morequotes.json : Aggressive stuff for ‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ô to say on top of already quality quotes in [narze/awesome-salim-quotes]("https://github.com/narze/awesome-salim-quotes")

* salim.json : ‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ô can send link to person's facebook, simply append a dictionary consists of 'url' and 'name' to the array!

### Keywords adding guideline

Keywords must be all lowercase (if english alphabet exists) and no space in it.

‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ô operate the sentences by ignoring spaces and turning all english alphabet into lowercase, for example

`sinovac, sInOvAc, S I N O V A C` will all trigger the "sinovac" keywords

### Trained by People

People in Discord can also train the bot by typing `!train <Quote>`

This can also be disabled or limited to some person in bot settings

Run utils/review.py to review pending words and add to file!

## üé∂ ‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ô as DJ
